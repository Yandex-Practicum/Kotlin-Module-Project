        Nobody can tell you
        There's only one song worth singing
        They may try and sell you
        Cause it hangs them up
        To see someone like you

        But you gotta make your own kind of music
        Sing your own special song
        Make your own kind of music
        Even if nobody else sings along

        You're gonna be nowhere
        The loneliest kind of lonely
        It may be rough going
        Just to do your thing is the hardest thing to do

        But you gotta make your own kind of music
        Sing your own special song
        Make your own kind of music
        Even if nobody else sings along

        So if you cannot take my hand
        And if you must be going, I will understand

        You gotta make your own kind of music
        Sing your own special song
        Make your own kind of music
        Even if nobody else sings along

        You gotta make your own kind of music
        Sing your own kind of song
        Make your own kind of music
        Even if nobody else sings along

        You gotta make your own kind of music
        Sing your own kind of song
        Make your own kind of music
        Even if nobody else sings along

        No no no no
        Even if nobody else sings along
        If nobody else sings along
